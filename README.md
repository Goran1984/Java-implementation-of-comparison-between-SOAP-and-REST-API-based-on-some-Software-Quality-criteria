# Java-implementation-of-comparison-between-SOAP-and-REST-API-based-on-some-Software-Quality-criteria
Nowadays the most common way to exchange data among information systems is to use Web services. 
Web services are self-contained, modular and dynamic applications by their nature. 
Most common implementations are based on SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) and REST (Representational State Transfer Protocol) styles. 
Each of these techniques offers different methods to invoke a web service and has its own advantages and disadvantages, 
so it is important to choose the right type of Web services, otherwise, it can lead to certain problems in data exchange or 
impose some restrictions. This project compares SOAP and REST approaches based on some standard software criterias, as a result, 
recommendations can be made on how to opt the right Web service type at a project design phase.
